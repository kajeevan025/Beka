## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn start

```

### Step 2: Start your Application

For Android

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn android
```

For iOS

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn ios
```

Happy coding! ðŸš€
